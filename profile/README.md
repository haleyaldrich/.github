## Hi there 👋

Lot's of awesome work happening here. Reach out to the org admins with any questions.

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Tags
To facilitate querying, we are using tags for each repository. The more tags, the better. The more specific the tags, the better.
Here are some conventions:
* Lowercase
* `geotechnics` not `geotechnical` not `geo` just `geotechnics`
